# LEMA -Local Efficient Multitasking Assistant v0.0.1
My take on creating an inteligent local assistant with some 'superpowers'. I have tested it on Windows OS but it should work under Linux aswell.

For this to work you need to install LMStudio , download a llama3 model ( in my case bartowski/Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Coder-v2-GGUF worked quite well with Lema) , 
set up LMStudio as server with llama3 preset ( very important , otherwise it will give out rubbish answers! )

Reqirements :   pip install -U openai tkinter pyautogui
